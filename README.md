# MyBlogsApp

Welcome To MyBlogsApp,

The purpose of this web app is to provide users with an online database on their travel as an adventure to their Life.
A user is able to create countries into the database for their travel purpose.
I chose this as my project third milestone project.I am a traveller myself and
am currently writing my own articles which in The life on the Road trip.
That why I think a blog site were people can tell their stories about their trip.

UX

The web app was created to allow users to add and easily access.
This site is intended for those who wish to read articles about travelling,blogs and wish to create their own adventures on a blog.
The colour scheme throughout is dark grey and dark blue, with the exception of the 'edit' and 'delete' buttons which are lighter blue and red respectively; this is to differentiate between what different buttons do so the user knows instantly what does what (dark blue creates, light blue edits, red deletes).
This gives a more unified and structured approach to the design and creates consistency.
The Articles edit and create features include a third party text editor.
This is because when using the standard HTML text editor the text would not be rendered into paragraphs or bold/italic any of the writing, which is not good for reading articles.
The Articles, Countries and Adventures (along with their respective create and edit pages) are all structured in a linear format;
this gives a minimalist style that is easy to learn and view and was done so using borders and aligning items centrally.
